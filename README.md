# advent-of-code
My take on solutions for the Advent of Code challenges from 2021, as a learning experience for me: https://adventofcode.com/2021

Goal was not to do the simplest, quickest or smartest solution but just trying out new things, doing it with the tools and knowledges I manage well but also trying to experiment with new methods, ideas and libraries.

Please refer to the link above, to appreciate the great work from them.
